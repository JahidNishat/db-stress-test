# Week 16: Career Strategy & Graduation

## The Transformation
You started as a backend engineer who "knew" Go and Postgres.
You are now a **Systems Engineer** who has built:
1.  **A Load Balancer** (Consistent Hashing, Health Checks).
2.  **A Database Stress Tester** (Worker Pools, TUI, Statistics).
3.  **Advanced DB Mechanics** (Isolation Levels, Locking, Indexes).

## 1. Resume Strategy
**Before:** "Used Go and Postgres to build APIs."
**After:** "Designed and implemented a distributed load testing tool capable of sustaining 1,500+ RPS. Optimized database locking strategies to eliminate deadlocks and reduce contention by 40% using optimistic locking patterns."

## 2. Interview Strategy
When asked "What is the hardest bug you solved?":
- Talk about the **Deadlock** in Week 5.
- Talk about the **Phantom Read** in Week 6.
- Talk about the **GC Pressure** in Week 4.

## 3. The Path Forward (Phase 5)
You have completed the technical foundation. Your next steps are:
- **System Design:** Learn how to combine these blocks (Load Balancer + Queue + DB) into a massive system like Uber/Twitter.
- **Kubernetes:** Learn how to deploy your `load-balancer` and `db-stress` to a cluster.
- **Open Source:** Publish `db-stress` to GitHub. It is good enough.

## Final Words
You have the skills. Now you need the confidence. 
You are not a "Junior" anymore. You are a builder.
